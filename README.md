# SellPro Bot

A bot to automatically complete SellPro courses.

If you've ever thought, "wouldn't it be awesome if I just simply didn't have to do these stupid courses to win somethingâ€¦"; I'm going to stop you right there. For the most part you don't have to, with this bot you can automate both the courses and their accompanying quizzes, making YOU the SellPro king.

Plus its kinda funny because you'll almost be guaranteed to be the highest on leaderboard at your store.
